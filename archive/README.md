# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived content that is not part of the main IDI (Intelligent Daemon Interface) project.

## Contents

### `alignment_theorem/`
Complete Alignment Theorem project including:
- `AlignmentTheorem/` - Main project folder
- `alignment_theorem_package/` - Package version
- `alignment_theorem_repo/` - Repository version
- `alignment_theorem_package.zip` - Archive file
- `docs/` - All Alignment Theorem documentation

**Note:** This content is preserved for historical reference but is not actively maintained as part of the IDI project.

### `lean_proofs/`
Lean proof system files:
- `lakefile.lean` - Lean project configuration
- `lean-toolchain` - Lean version specification
- `lake-manifest.json` - Lean package manifest
- `proofs/` - Formal proofs (Alignment Theorem)

**Note:** These files are related to the Alignment Theorem formal verification and are not needed for IDI development.

## Why Archived?

The IDI project focuses on:
- Intelligent agent development toolkit
- Q-learning training systems
- Zero-knowledge proof integration
- Tau Language agent specifications

The Alignment Theorem content, while related to deflationary economics, is a separate research project with its own formal proofs and documentation.
