# Tau Language Experiment 03: Memory/Delay
# Output equals previous input (1-step delay)
# Tests: temporal lookback (t-1)

# Define streams
i1 : sbf = in console.
o1 : sbf = out console.

# Spec: output equals previous input
# At t=0, o1[0] is unspecified since i1[-1] doesn't exist
o1[t] = i1[t-1].
