# Tau Language Experiment 04: Toggle
# Output toggles between 0 and 1 based on input signal
# When input=1, output toggles; when input=0, output stays the same
# Tests: conditional logic, state tracking

# Define streams
i1 : sbf = in console.
o1 : sbf = out console.

# Spec: Toggle behavior
# If input is 1, output is complement of previous output
# If input is 0, output stays the same as previous
o1[t] = (i1[t] & o1[t-1]') | (i1[t]' & o1[t-1]).
